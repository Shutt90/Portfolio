    <p class = "transparent">I finally took the opportunity in late 2020 to pursue what I've always wanted to do... LEARN TO PROGRAM
        <br>
    Most people would of considered the lockdown of 2020/21 to be a bad thing, but being someone who always regretted not going to university and studying Computer Science I took it as an opportunity to pursue my dreams.<br>
    I predominantly came from a background in sales, focusing on multiple client retenion and recruitment - Through my own intiive I decided that it was time to make the change I wanted, hang up the phone for the final time and pursue my dream career in programming. A few courses on Udemy, Freecodecamp, Codecademy, YouTube and books later, I'm now feeling confident that I can enter the job market and take on my first role as a junior developer. </p>
